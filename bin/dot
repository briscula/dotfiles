# `dot` handles installation, updates, things like that. Run it periodically
# to make sure you're on the latest and greatest.

# shortcut to this dotfiles path is $ZSHDOT - one of the two places where I have to export this
export ZSHDOT=$HOME/.dotfiles

# Set OS X defaults
$ZSHDOT/macos/set-defaults.sh

# Install homebrew
$ZSHDOT/homebrew/install.sh 2>&1

# Upgrade homebrew
echo "› brew update"
brew update

# Install software
echo "› $ZSHDOT/script/install"
$ZSHDOT/script/install
